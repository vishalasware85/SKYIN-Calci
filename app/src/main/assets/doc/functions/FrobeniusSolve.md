## FrobeniusSolve

```
FrobeniusSolve({a1, … ,aN}, M)
```

> get a list of solutions for the Frobenius equation given by the list of integers `{a1, … ,aN}` and the non-negative integer `M`.

The Frobenius problem, also known as the postage-stamp problem or the money-changing problem, is an integer programming problem that seeks nonnegative integer solutions to `x1*a1 + … + xN*aN = M` where `ai` and `M` are positive integers.
In particular, the Frobenius number `FrobeniusNumber({a1, … ,aN})`, is the largest `M` so that this equation fails to have a solution.
